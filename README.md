# useRef Hook Demo in React

This project demonstrates the usage of the `useRef` hook in React to interact with DOM elements imperatively.

## Description

The main purpose of this project is to illustrate how to use the `useRef` hook to manipulate DOM elements directly without triggering re-renders in React. Specifically, it showcases changing styles of an element on a button click.

## Features

- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Clicking the "Enable dark mode" button changes the background color, padding, text color, width, height, margin, and border radius of an element using the `useRef` hook.
- **Simple Implementation**: Minimal setup to focus on understanding how `useRef` interacts with DOM elements.
